My name is **Dat** Nguyen, I'm an engineer with 10+ years of experience building fault-tolerant, [distributed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) using [**Erlang/OTP**](https://www.erlang.org/) in [cloud-native](https://cloudnative.io/) environments. I am passionate about applying [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [resilient architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) to high-availability platforms supporting [real-time communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_communication), [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation), and [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry).

I've contributed to [telecom infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network) ([Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/)), [network automation platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_automation) ([Cisco ConfD/NSO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/network-services-orchestrator/index.html)), and large-scale [communication services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_service) (Voice, [IVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response), WhatsApp, SMS, [USSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data)) at [PxD](https://precisiondev.org/). At [5GenCare](https://5gencare.com/), I design and operate real-time [IoT/AIoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things),high-availability backends focused on device communication and [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing).

Driven by a passion for [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [resilient architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance), I focus on building high-availability systems that are [scalable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability), [maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability), and built to last. I also actively contribute to the [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org/) ecosystem.

I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the [University of Information Technology, Vietnam](https://en.uit.edu.vn/), with [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)-published research on hybrid geolocation using [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/) and [Semtech LR1110](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/lr1110).
