My name is Dat Nguyen, and I am a Senior <span style="color: #e74c3c;">[Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org/)</span> Engineer with over 10+ years of experience building fault-tolerant, <span style="color: #3498db;">[distributed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)</span> in <span style="color: #9b59b6;">[cloud-native](https://cloudnative.io/)</span> environments. I am passionate about applying <span style="color: #f39c12;">[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)</span> and <span style="color: #e67e22;">[resilient architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance)</span> to high-availability platforms supporting <span style="color: #1abc9c;">[real-time communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_communication)</span>, <span style="color: #34495e;">[automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation)</span>, and <span style="color: #16a085;">[telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry)</span>.

I began my career at <span style="color: #e74c3c;">[DEK Technologies](https://www.dektech.com.au/)</span>, where I contributed to telecom core components for <span style="color: #3498db;">[Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/)</span> and later worked on network automation features for <span style="color: #9b59b6;">[Cisco NSO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/network-services-orchestrator/index.html)</span>. I then joined <span style="color: #f39c12;">[Precision Development (PxD)](https://precisiondev.org/)</span> as a Senior Fullstack Engineer, building distributed voice/text systems for low-connectivity environments. Currently, I work at <span style="color: #e67e22;">[5Gencare](https://5gencare.com/)</span> as a Senior Erlang Cloud Engineer, architecting distributed <span style="color: #1abc9c;">[IoT/AIoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)</span> backend systems.

I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the <span style="color: #e74c3c;">[University of Information Technology, Vietnam](https://en.uit.edu.vn/)</span>, where my thesis focused on hybrid geolocation gateways using <span style="color: #3498db;">[LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/)</span> and <span style="color: #9b59b6;">[Semtech LR1110](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/lr1110)</span>. My research work on <span style="color: #e74c3c;">[hybrid geolocation gateways for IoT applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9598262)</span> was published in IEEE and demonstrates my expertise in <span style="color: #f39c12;">[telecommunications infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network)</span> and IoT positioning systems.

Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about <span style="color: #e67e22;">[open-source development](https://opensource.org/)</span> and contributing to the Erlang/OTP ecosystem. I believe in building systems that are not only technically robust but also <span style="color: #1abc9c;">[scalable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability)</span> and <span style="color: #16a085;">[maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability)</span> for long-term success.
