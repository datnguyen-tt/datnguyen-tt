My name is Dat Nguyen, and I am a Senior Erlang/OTP Engineer with over 10 years of experience building fault-tolerant, distributed systems in cloud-native environments. I am passionate about applying functional programming and resilient architecture to high-availability platforms supporting real-time communication, automation, and telemetry.

I began my career at DEK Technologies, where I contributed to telecom core components for Ericsson and later worked on network automation features for Cisco NSO. I then joined Precision Development (PxD) as a Cloud Systems Engineer, building distributed voice/text systems for low-connectivity environments. Currently, I work at 5Gencare as a Senior Erlang Cloud Engineer, architecting distributed IoT/AIoT backend systems.

I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the University of Information Technology, Vietnam, where my thesis focused on hybrid geolocation gateways using LoRaWAN and Semtech LR1110. My research interests include distributed systems, cloud-native architecture, and telecommunications infrastructure.

Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about open-source development and contributing to the Erlang/OTP ecosystem. I believe in building systems that are not only technically robust but also scalable and maintainable for long-term success.
