## Introduction

Erlang/OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a powerful framework for building fault-tolerant, distributed systems. With over 10 years of experience in this domain, I've seen firsthand how Erlang's actor model and OTP principles can create highly reliable systems.

## Key OTP Components

### GenServer
The GenServer behavior is the foundation of most Erlang applications. It provides:
- State management
- Message handling
- Error recovery
- Hot code upgrades

### Supervision Trees
OTP's supervision strategy ensures system resilience:
- Automatic restart of failed processes
- Hierarchical process management
- Configurable restart strategies

## Real-World Applications

In my work with 5Gencare, we built distributed IoT/AIoT backends using:
- Erlang/OTP for core services
- Mnesia for distributed databases
- Docker for containerization
- Prometheus for monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Always use supervision trees** for process management
2. **Implement proper error handling** with try-catch blocks
3. **Use hot code upgrades** for zero-downtime deployments
4. **Monitor system health** with tools like Prometheus

## Conclusion

Erlang/OTP remains one of the most effective tools for building distributed, fault-tolerant systems. Its principles of "let it crash" and process isolation make it ideal for mission-critical applications.
