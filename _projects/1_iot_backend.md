## Project Overview

As Senior Erlang Cloud Engineer at 5Gencare, I architected and maintained a distributed IoT/AIoT backend system built with Erlang/OTP and Mnesia. This mission-critical system handles real-time telemetry data from thousands of IoT devices across multiple regions, providing cloud telemetry and device management capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Device Management**: Registration, authentication, and lifecycle management for IoT devices
- **Telemetry Processing**: Real-time data ingestion and analysis from AIoT sensors
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Container-based deployment with Docker and GitLab CI
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing for distributed services

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Erlang/OTP, Mnesia (distributed database)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, GitLab CI for automated deployments
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection
- **Security**: TLS/OpenSSL for secure communications

## Key Features

### Distributed System Design
- **Fault Tolerance**: Leveraging Erlang's actor model for automatic recovery
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime through distributed supervision trees
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple nodes
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second latency for telemetry data

### Cloud Telemetry
- **Device Registration**: Automated onboarding of IoT devices
- **Data Ingestion**: High-throughput processing of sensor data
- **Alert System**: Intelligent monitoring and notification engine
- **API Gateway**: RESTful interfaces for external integrations

## Results

### Performance Achievements
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime achieved through fault-tolerant design
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent IoT devices
- **Latency**: Sub-second response times for telemetry data
- **Maintainability**: Zero-downtime hot code upgrades

### Business Impact
- **Device Management**: Streamlined IoT device lifecycle management
- **Data Processing**: Real-time analytics for AIoT applications
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated deployment and monitoring
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization through containerization

## Impact

This system serves as the foundation for 5Gencare's IoT platform, enabling customers to deploy and manage IoT devices at scale while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and security standards. The architecture has been adopted by multiple teams and serves as a reference implementation for distributed IoT systems.
