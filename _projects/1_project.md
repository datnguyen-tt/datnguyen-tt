## Project Overview

As Senior Erlang Cloud Engineer at 5Gencare, I architected and maintained a distributed IoT/AIoT backend system built with Erlang/OTP and Mnesia. This mission-critical system handles real-time telemetry data from thousands of IoT devices across multiple regions.

## Technical Architecture

The system leverages Erlang's actor model and OTP principles to achieve:
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery from hardware and software failures
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime through distributed supervision trees
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple nodes
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second latency for telemetry data

## Key Components

### Core Services
- **Device Management**: Registration, authentication, and lifecycle management
- **Telemetry Processing**: Real-time data ingestion and analysis
- **Alert System**: Intelligent monitoring and notification engine
- **API Gateway**: RESTful interfaces for external integrations

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Erlang/OTP, Mnesia (distributed database)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, TLS/OpenSSL
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI for automated deployments

## Results

- **Performance**: 50% reduction in system latency
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime achieved
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent devices
- **Maintainability**: Zero-downtime hot code upgrades

## Impact

This system serves as the foundation for 5Gencare's IoT platform, enabling customers to deploy and manage IoT devices at scale while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and security standards.
