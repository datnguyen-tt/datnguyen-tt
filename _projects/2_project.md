## Project Overview

At Precision Development (PxD), I built distributed voice/text systems with Erlang for low-connectivity environments. This project focused on creating reliable communication infrastructure for mission-critical operations in challenging network conditions, integrating telecom protocols for time-sensitive communication flows.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Voice Processing**: FreeSWITCH integration for call handling and routing
- **Text Messaging**: USSD/IVR/SMS protocols for basic communication
- **Service APIs**: RESTful interfaces for external system connectivity
- **Metrics & Tracing**: Comprehensive monitoring for production systems

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Erlang (Cowboy web server)
- **Voice**: FreeSWITCH for call routing and management
- **Protocols**: USSD/IVR/SMS for text-based communication
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS (EC2, S3)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Web Framework**: Flask for API development

## Key Features

### Low-Connectivity Optimization
- **Intermittent Connectivity**: Systems designed for unreliable network connections
- **Bandwidth Constraints**: Optimized for minimal data usage
- **Latency Tolerance**: Designed for high-latency communication scenarios
- **Offline Capability**: Local processing and message queuing

### Mission-Critical Operations
- **Reliability Features**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed messages
- **Message Prioritization**: Critical messages get higher priority
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time delivery confirmation
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple communication channels

## Results

### Performance Achievements
- **Reliability**: 99.5% message delivery success rate in challenging conditions
- **Performance**: 80% reduction in communication latency
- **Scalability**: Support for 5,000+ concurrent users
- **Cost Efficiency**: 60% reduction in infrastructure costs

### Business Impact
- **Communication Reliability**: Enabled dependable communication in low-connectivity regions
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined mission-critical communication flows
- **Production Stability**: Resolved time-sensitive production issues
- **System Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and tracing for operational insights

## Impact

This system enabled reliable communication in regions with poor network infrastructure, supporting humanitarian and development projects that require dependable communication channels. The architecture has been adopted by multiple teams and serves as a reference implementation for resilient communication systems.
