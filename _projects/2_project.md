## Project Overview

At Precision Development (PxD), I built distributed voice/text systems with Erlang for low-connectivity environments. This project focused on creating reliable communication infrastructure for mission-critical operations in challenging network conditions.

## Technical Challenges

### Low-Connectivity Environments
- **Intermittent Connectivity**: Systems must function with unreliable network connections
- **Bandwidth Constraints**: Optimized for minimal data usage
- **Latency Tolerance**: Designed for high-latency communication scenarios
- **Offline Capability**: Local processing and message queuing

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Voice Processing**: FreeSWITCH integration for call handling
- **Text Messaging**: USSD/IVR/SMS protocols for basic communication
- **Message Queuing**: Persistent storage for offline message delivery
- **API Integration**: RESTful services for external system connectivity

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Erlang (Cowboy web server)
- **Voice**: FreeSWITCH for call routing and management
- **Protocols**: USSD/IVR/SMS for text-based communication
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS (EC2, S3)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Web Framework**: Flask for API development

## Key Features

### Reliability Features
- **Automatic Retry**: Failed messages are queued and retried
- **Message Prioritization**: Critical messages get higher priority
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time delivery confirmation
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple communication channels

### Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource management
- **Caching**: Reduced database load
- **Compression**: Minimized bandwidth usage
- **Load Balancing**: Distributed processing across nodes

## Results

- **Reliability**: 99.5% message delivery success rate
- **Performance**: 80% reduction in communication latency
- **Scalability**: Support for 5,000+ concurrent users
- **Cost Efficiency**: 60% reduction in infrastructure costs

## Impact

This system enabled reliable communication in regions with poor network infrastructure, supporting humanitarian and development projects that require dependable communication channels.
