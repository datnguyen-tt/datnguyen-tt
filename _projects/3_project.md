## Project Overview

As Cisco Consultant / Remote Engineer at DEK Technologies Vietnam, I delivered fault-tolerant network automation features in Cisco NSO using Erlang and YANG. Applied Domain-Driven Design principles to translate networking models into business logic, resolving deep concurrency bugs and enhancing system reliability.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Network Automation**: Cisco NSO platform for network service orchestration
- **Model-Driven Development**: YANG data modeling for network configuration
- **Concurrency Management**: Erlang-based fault-tolerant processing
- **Business Logic**: Domain-Driven Design implementation for networking models

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Erlang for concurrent processing and fault tolerance
- **Network Protocols**: NETCONF, RESTCONF for network device communication
- **Data Modeling**: YANG for network configuration schemas
- **Development Tools**: Python, Emacs Lisp for development automation
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins for automated testing and deployment

## Key Features

### Network Automation
- **Service Orchestration**: Automated network service provisioning and management
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized network device configuration
- **Fault Tolerance**: Erlang-based concurrency for reliable network operations
- **Model Translation**: YANG models translated to business logic using DDD

### Development Excellence
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Applied DDD principles to networking domain models
- **Concurrency Optimization**: Resolved deep concurrency bugs in distributed systems
- **System Reliability**: Enhanced fault tolerance and error handling
- **Development Automation**: Emacs Lisp scripting for development efficiency

## Results

### Technical Achievements
- **Fault Tolerance**: Improved system reliability through Erlang concurrency
- **Network Automation**: Streamlined network service provisioning
- **Bug Resolution**: Resolved complex concurrency issues in distributed systems
- **Development Efficiency**: Enhanced development workflow with automation

### Business Impact
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated network configuration and management
- **System Reliability**: Enhanced fault tolerance for critical network operations
- **Development Velocity**: Improved development speed through DDD principles
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation processes

## Impact

This work contributed to Cisco's network automation platform, enabling more reliable and efficient network operations. The Domain-Driven Design approach and concurrency optimizations have influenced best practices for network automation systems.

## Technical Contributions

### Concurrency Solutions
- **Process Supervision**: Implemented robust supervision trees for fault tolerance
- **Message Passing**: Optimized Erlang message passing for network operations
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error recovery mechanisms for network failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved system performance through concurrency patterns
