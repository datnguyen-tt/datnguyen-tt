## Project Overview

As Cisco Consultant / Onsite Engineer at DEK Technologies Sweden, I collaborated with Cisco's architecture team to integrate scalable services across sites. Led knowledge-sharing sessions on OTP design and BEAM optimization, contributing to the development of enterprise-grade network solutions.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Service Integration**: Scalable services integration across multiple sites
- **Architecture Design**: Collaboration with Cisco's core architecture team
- **Knowledge Transfer**: OTP design patterns and BEAM optimization techniques
- **Cross-site Coordination**: Multi-site service deployment and management

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Erlang/OTP for distributed system development
- **BEAM VM**: Optimization and performance tuning
- **Architecture Patterns**: OTP design patterns and best practices
- **Site Integration**: Multi-site service coordination and deployment

## Key Features

### Architecture Integration
- **Scalable Services**: Design and implementation of horizontally scalable services
- **Site Coordination**: Integration of services across multiple geographical locations
- **Performance Optimization**: BEAM VM optimization for high-performance applications
- **Architecture Patterns**: Implementation of proven OTP design patterns

### Knowledge Leadership
- **OTP Design Sessions**: Led knowledge-sharing sessions on OTP design principles
- **BEAM Optimization**: Expertise sharing on BEAM VM performance tuning
- **Best Practices**: Documentation and sharing of Erlang development best practices
- **Team Collaboration**: Cross-functional collaboration with Cisco's architecture team

## Results

### Technical Achievements
- **Service Integration**: Successfully integrated scalable services across multiple sites
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved system performance through BEAM optimization
