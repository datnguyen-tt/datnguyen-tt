## Project Overview

As Ericsson Consultant at DEK Technologies Vietnam, I contributed to **[IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/cloud-software-and-services/cloud-core/communication-services-udm-and-exposure/communication-services--udm/cloud-ims)** [Session Border Gateway (SBG)](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/cloud-software-and-services/cloud-core/communication-services-udm-and-exposure/communication-services--udm/cloud-ims/session-border-controller) components, a standardized architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia services in telecommunications networks. This mission-critical infrastructure enables voice, video, and data services for millions of users through advanced protocol handling, media control, and fault tolerance mechanisms.

## IMS Architecture & Technology

The **IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)** is a standardized architectural framework designed by 3GPP for delivering IP multimedia services over both wireless and wireline networks. It provides a horizontal control layer that isolates access networks from service layers, enabling fixed-mobile convergence (FMC) and supporting services like:

- **VoLTE (Voice over LTE)**: High-quality voice calls over 4G/5G networks
- **ViLTE (Video over LTE)**: Real-time video calling capabilities  
- **RCS (Rich Communication Services)**: Advanced messaging and presence features
- **Wi-Fi Calling**: Seamless voice calls over Wi-Fi networks
- **SMS/MMS over IP**: Text messaging over packet-switched networks

### Session Border Gateway (SBG)
The SBG serves as a critical security and control point in IMS networks, managing:
- **Session Control**: SIP session establishment, modification, and termination
- **Media Control**: Real-time media processing for voice/video streams
- **Security**: Network protection and access control
- **Protocol Translation**: Seamless communication between different network domains
